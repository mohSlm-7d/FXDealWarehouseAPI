# FXDealWarehouseAPI
 A data warehouse system for Bloomberg to analyze FX deals. It accepts deals and their details from the customers and persists these deals in the Database.

   1. dealId.
   2. fromCurrencyISOCode.
   3. toCurrencyISOCode.
   4. dealTimestamp.
   5. dealAmount.
 
	In addition to the above fields, the bean has a Primary Key that is generated by the Database as a sequence and its name is sequentialId. All of the fields above are Not Nullable.

  # ValidationÂ rules of the FXDeal Bean Fields:
   1. dealId: It has a unique Unique Constraint on the Database, and it is an Alphanumeric String and its length must be at least of 8 characters and does not exceed 20 characters. The FX Deal's ID cannot contain spaces. 
   2. fromCurrencyISOCode: The FX Deal's Currency ISO Codes must be String that contain exactly 3 digits with no spaces.
   3. toCurrencyISOCode: The FX Deal's Currency ISO Codes must be String that contain exactly 3 digits with no spaces.
   4. dealTimestamp: The FX Deal's Timestamp must be today or in future.
   5. dealAmount: The FX Deal's amount must be a positive whole number and do not contain a decimal point. The Deal Amount must have at least one digit and do not exceed 9 digits.

	For the FXDeal to be valid each field of the FxDeal fields cannot be empty. However, if any of the above constraints is not met the system will throw a customized exception with the proper error message, and the FXDeal Service will handle it and return the appropriate response based on the thrown exception.

 	In the end, Junit was used to carry out the Unit Testing process, especially to ensure that the FXDealValidator class was working appropriately.
